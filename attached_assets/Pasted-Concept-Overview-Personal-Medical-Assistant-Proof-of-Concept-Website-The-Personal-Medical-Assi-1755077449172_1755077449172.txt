Concept Overview – “Personal Medical Assistant” (Proof of Concept Website)
The Personal Medical Assistant is a location-aware, AI-powered web platform designed to assist travelers in managing unexpected health issues while abroad.

Example Scenario:
A traveler from Jakarta arrives in Thailand and suddenly feels unwell. Through the website, they can interact with a medical chatbot that:

Understands the user’s symptoms through a natural conversation.

Analyzes their condition using an AI-powered health assistant.

Searches for prescriptive medications using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from medical PDFs.

Finds locally available alternatives — tailored to Thailand’s pharmacies and over-the-counter rules.

Provides a clear medicine list (both prescribed and alternative) along with exact pharmacy or convenience store locations.

Displays results on an interactive map so the user can see where to buy the medicine immediately.
